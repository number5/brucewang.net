Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of
varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a
highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure
originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual
property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first
appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a significant one--was
something quite different.</p>
<p>First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation
we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a
wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology,
media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are
currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also
working with the relevant U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers
was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.
Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not
achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been
accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as
the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the
content of emails themselves.</p>
<p>Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on
Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China-
and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China
appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts
have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most
likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users' computers.</p>
<p>We have already used information gained from this attack to make
infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for
Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise
people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their
computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update
their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing
in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal
information like passwords online. You can read more here about our
cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these
kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report (PDF), Nart
Villeneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.</p>
<p>We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these
attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human
rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this
information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about
freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China's economic reform
programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of
millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is
at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world
today.</p>
<p>We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of
increased access to information for people in China and a more open
Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results.
At the time we made clear that "we will carefully monitor conditions in
China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we
determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will
not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China."</p>
<p>These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with
the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the
web--have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of
our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer
willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the
next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the
basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the
law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down
Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.</p>
<p>The decision to review our business operations in China has been
incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching
consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven by our
executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of
our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn
the success it is today. We are committed to working responsibly to
resolve the very difficult issues raised.</p>
