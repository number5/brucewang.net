(精华总在评论中! -- [slashdot](http://slashdot.org)的名言)

> **DRM is about forcing you to run particular EXACT code, and either
> not running at all or refusing to talk to you if you are not.** This
> also happens to be the essence of DRM too... so it's a happy
> coincidence for the pro-DRMer within the technology companies.

> Treacherous Computing is hardware that is meant to allow person X to
> set their hardware up to refuse to run (or not cage) software that is
> not digitally signed by them. As you can imagine, this COULD be
> extremely valuable for security. HOWEVER, the collection of companies
> making up the Trusted Computing Group (most of the tech companies)
> decided that the capability to TRUST should be reserved for them. You
> do not get to override it. This "trust" (only running approved code)
> starts with the BIOS, moves up to the kernel and in stuff like Vista
> it then moves into the media subsystem. In a few years, it will move
> into applications like web browsers, or word processors. Not running
> Microsoft Word? No you can't open that document, sorry. Add into this
> nasty mix, the ability of Trusted Computing hardware to execute code
> IN SECRET, and you have a control freak's wet dream. Not only can you
> not change what your computer does, you cannot even know what it is up

> Imagine it this way: a prison is very useful for keeping criminals in.
> It's not so good if YOU are the convict. In trusted computing as it is

> Trusted Computing is a political issue because it is a massive power

注: Treacherous Computing = Trusted Computing
