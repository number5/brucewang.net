The most thing I love about [OpenID](http://openid.net)is that it's
a \***decentralized**\* identity system, anyone with enough knowledge
could setup a OpenID server in minutes, and with YADIS delegation
support you can switch your identity provider in seconds, so there is no
single failure point, and there is no Big Brother could control or
monitor everything.

Yes, the url scheme still depends on DNS system, but DNS system is
an \*open system\* and running successfully for decades to support the
Internet. We all known how DNS system work and trusted it for a very
long time.

So please don't make simple things complicated, i-names could be easily
support using [idproxy.net](http://idproxy.net)-like proxy, we don't
need it in the core OpenID spec.
